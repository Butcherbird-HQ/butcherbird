      'Before Butcherbird, Superior was a few hundred reps going door to door, WhatsApp message by WhatsApp message. Great product — French oils, ISO 22716 certified. Linear growth. One conversation, one agent, one sale at a time. With a ceiling built into the model.\n\nWe rebranded it first. New visual identity. New positioning. Creative that made a R70 fragrance feel like it belonged next to the designers it was inspired by. The product always had the quality — the brand now matched it.\n\nThen we built two machines simultaneously.\n\nMachine 1: Agent recruitment. "Buy for R35, sell for R70 — 100% profit on every bottle." Simple, direct, mathematically undeniable. Static ads outperformed video every time. The math did the selling. Dozens of angles tested weekly — winners scaled, losers cut.\n\nMachine 2: Direct to consumer. Running in parallel. Buy 2 Get 1 Free. Designer comparison ads. Two audiences, two campaigns, one brand growing from both ends at once.\n\nFrom hundreds of reps to a national network. 100,000+ units per month. 4,000+ active agents. Top creative at 8.28× ROAS. Distribution across South Africa, with Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Lesotho, Eswatini, and Namibia already underway.\n\nSuperior is proof that the biggest growth lever isn\'t always paid acquisition. Sometimes it\'s building the right distribution model — and then running performance media on top of it.',

The Shopify store existed — but it was quiet, with no traffic and no strategy behind it.\n\nThe owner had held off on advertising because she was afraid it would dilute what made Lakrids special. Premium packaging, slow-cooked product, boutique deli positioning. This wasn\'t a brand you could slap a "50% OFF!!!" banner on and push to cold audiences.\n\nSo we didn\'t.\n\nWe treated the brand the way it deserved to be treated — like a luxury house, not a DTC startup. No urgency tactics. No countdown timers. Premium photography. Static ads that looked like they belonged in a magazine, not a Facebook feed.\n\nA single "Indulge In Luxury" static hit 25.39× ROAS — converting at 43× on its best day before it was ended during a campaign switch. The Black Friday campaign hit 45.23× ROAS at its peak and was also shut down early. These are our most painful documented mistakes — proof that knowing when not to stop a campaign is as important as knowing how to start one.\n\nThe result: 120% total business growth year on year. Not just online — the whole business. An online revenue channel built from zero, now a core part of the operation.\n\nThe owner had been afraid advertising would cheapen the brand. Instead it amplified it. The same elegance, the same craftsmanship, the same quiet confidence — just in front of thousands more people.',

And when the founders pushed for answers, they got vague explanations and recycled strategies.\n\nThat\'s the reality of most agency relationships. You sign up thinking you\'re getting a partner. What you get is a slot in a rotation. Your brand doesn\'t get studied. Your category doesn\'t get dissected. Your creative doesn\'t get tested with real intent.\n\nNumuti came to us burned. The budget had been wasted. The trust was gone.\n\nWe started by doing what the previous agency never did: we actually learned the brand.\n\nThe drinks category is fast, emotional, and driven by association. You don\'t sell a tonic with a features list — you sell a feeling. "Stock The Cooler" hit 4.80× ROAS. "Ditch The Hangover" hit 5.56× before it was even fully scaled. A single beach video hit 9.15× ROAS. An "Unwind Pool" concept touched 18.86× on minimal spend.\n\nNo autopilot. No set-and-forget. Find the angles that work, cut the ones that don\'t, scale the winners. Every week.\n\nR108,000 in revenue in a single month — their best month ever, and the first time they cracked R100K. Revenue more than doubled in five months. 22% average month-on-month growth. Not a spike — a trajectory.\n\nNumuti came to us burned.

      'Bonnie Bio was built on shelves. Plant-based, internationally certified compostable alternatives to plastic — refuse bags, cling wrap, air fryer liners, insect repellent — all sold through retail stores across South Africa.\n\nThe product was proven. The certifications were real. But shelf space alone doesn\'t build a brand. People walked past compostable products every day without knowing what they were or why they mattered.\n\nBonnie Bio needed reach. Not just more shelves — more awareness.\n\nWe built the awareness engine.\n\nCategory-specific ads that educated people on what compostable actually means — without being preachy. "Looks Like Plastic. Isn\'t." "Change Nothing. Waste Less." Simple messaging that made the switch feel effortless. Each product got its own creative strategy — bags, cling wrap, air fryer liners, insect repellent — because each one solves a different problem for a different person.\n\nMore people seeing Bonnie Bio online meant more people recognising it on the shelf. The paid media became the awareness engine that retail alone could never be — driving brand recognition, product education, and purchase intent at scale.\n\nOnline sales followed naturally, adding a revenue channel that didn\'t exist before. But the real win was bigger than ecommerce: a retail brand that people now actively looked for in store — because they\'d already seen it, understood it, and trusted it.',

Powder-and-scoop, everyday format — not the kind marketed at elite athletes with neon packaging. The kind you mix into a glass of water before work, or into your kid's bottle before school. People who try it, love it. The product has retail placement in Faithful to Nature and Wellness Warehouse. The challenge is the market.\n\nWe've been working with Kokee since October 2025. In that time: a single ad hit 27× ROAS on a Tuesday. A week where cost per purchase dropped from R500 to R199. A Family Offer creative that became the best-performing asset in the account. Revenue climbed 41% in February alone.\n\nThe process is deliberate. We restructured the entire account — shifted from warm-only targeting that had exhausted itself to a proper broad prospecting and retargeting architecture. We've been running systematic angle testing: offer hooks, problem-agitation, retargeting sequences. Every week, more data. Every week, the signal gets cleaner.\n\nOur fee is tied to Kokee's revenue. When they grow, we earn. That's not a line — it's the reason we're still here, still building, still finding the next angle instead of moving on to an easier account.\n\nKokee's trajectory is pointing in one direction.

He did everything himself.\n\nBy January, ad submissions were generating R21,000 in studio bookings from R3,000 in spend.

One ad alone generated R55,000 at 7.37× ROAS.\n\nThen the data became the pitch. BUUB walked into Dis-Chem and Wellness Warehouse with real purchase volume and a clear trajectory. The buyers said yes. A brand that started at beach markets now sits on shelves in 400+ stores nationwide.\n\nBUUB is the proof of concept for everything Butcherbird does.
